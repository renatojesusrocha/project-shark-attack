# Project Shark Attack - Second project in the Ironhack Data Analytics course.
Data cleaning project with a database extracted from the internet. The work aimed to define a business question and work on top of the database to answer its business question. 

## Business Question: What activities were responsible for the increase in shark bites in the 21st century? What are the reasons?

My main goal was to understand what activity was responsible for the increase in shark attacks around the world. It is necessary to understand that the growth of many activities have helped this increase.

I have found that since the beginning of the century we have had an increase of more than 20% in attacks. 
In the presentation file I remind you of the reasons.
I created this process in the second month of the course, in February 2022.
